# Anomaly Detection in CloudWatch Traffic Data

## Summary
This project focuses on detecting anomalies in CloudWatch traffic data using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to identify potential web attacks by analyzing traffic patterns. The project leverages the Isolation Forest algorithm for anomaly detection and includes comprehensive data preprocessing steps. Visualization tools such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly are used to present the results effectively.

### Techniques Used:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling datetime features and calculating duration.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Using Isolation Forest from scikit-learn.
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for plotting results.
- **Evaluation**: Confusion matrix for performance evaluation.
